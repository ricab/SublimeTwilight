# xyTwilight Sublime Text 3 Theme


## About
This is a copy of the Twilight theme for `Sublime Text`, that works great with `Markdown` -- and even better with the [Markdown Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-markdown-extended) plugin.

- Test if this also works for ST2?
- Change highlight color of current-line.
